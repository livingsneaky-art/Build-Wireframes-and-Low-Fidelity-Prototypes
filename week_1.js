//Storyboarding and wireframing
/*
    Welcome to the world of wireframes! You'll start by learning how to use research findings to inform ideation during the design process. 
    Next, you'll create two types of storyboards: big picture and close-up. Then, you'll draw your first wireframes, and you'll explore the 
    benefits of wireframing. Keep in mind that at this point in the design process, you should have lots of ideas for designs that address 
    real user needs. You want to refine those ideas, and wireframing can help you do that.

    Learning Objectives
    - Build a goal statement
    - Outline a user flow
    - Create big picture and close-up storyboards, and understand when to use each type
    - Explain the difference between low-fidelity and high-fidelity design
    - Describe the purpose of wireframing in the design process
    - Apply the basics of drawing

//User research to inform ideation
//Welcome to week 1

//Use research to inform ideation
/*
    Personas
        - Fictional users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of users
    User story
        - Fictional one-sentence story told form a persona's point of view to inspire and inform design decisions
    User journey
        - The series of experience a user has as they interact with your product

//Optional - Learn more about how research inform ideation
/*
    - Empathy maps = explore users’ four main motivations: what the user says, thinks, does, and feels. The insights gathered from 
        empathy maps help you come up with ideas for solutions that address the user’s real problems. 

    - Personas = place the users who you’re designing for front-and-center. By creating detailed user profiles, you can clearly 
        envision potential users that you’d design for.

    - User stories = determine which user needs are the most critical to address with your designs. This direction will help focus your ideation.

    - User journeys = help you come up with ideas for designs that truly support the users’ needs and solve their problems. 

    - Problem statement = is a clear description of the user’s need that should be addressed. The problem statement you created in 
        the last course will guide the focus of your ideation.

    Product goal statement
        - One or two sentences that describe a product and its benefits for the user

    Goal statement
        - [What] the product lets users do
        - [Who] the action affects
        - [Why] the action positively affects users
        - [How] the effectiveness of the product is measured

    Goal Statement
        - Our [product(what)] will let users [perform specific actions(what)] which will affect [describe who the action will affect(who)]
        by [describe how the action will positively affect users(why)]. We will measure effectiveness by [describe how you will measure the impact].
            Example:
                Our [dog walking app] will let users [schedule dog walkers quickly and easily] which will affect [Pet owners] by
                [allowing them to choose the most convenient times and dates to have their dog walked]. We will measure effectiveness by
                [analyzing the number of daily and weekly appointments.]

    Problem Statement
        - [username] is a [user characteristics] who needs [user need] because [insight].
            Example:
                - [Drew] is a [pet owner in a small town] who needs [to find and schedule a dog walker] because [they work the night shift].
